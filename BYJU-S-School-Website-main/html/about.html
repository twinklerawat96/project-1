            The school curriculum and methodology cater to the all-round development of every student. The unique teaching methods oriented into the school system is ever-vibrant and innovative. Our Teachers are initiated to howard gardner's concept of multiple intelligence, the nine types of intelligence and the manner in which lesson plans in each subject could be planned to focus on each type of intelligence. The necessity of immersion, relaxed alertness and active processing of experience, if meaningful learning is to take place. Teachers were given hands-on training and one topic per term is dealt with using the multiple intelligence format. This ensures that a wide range of activities are planned to hone a variety of skills. On science day a well-conceived programme on 'multiple intelligence' was one of the prized presentations.
